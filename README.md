### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Fresh graduate with a 2:1 games development degree, I am looking for opportunities as software or games developer. My main programming language is C++ that I have used for the past 3 years both during my degree and with extra-curricular activities like the role I covered at team DIANA for a year, although I have a basic experience of JavaScript as well.
I love programming, no matter the industry as long as the project has a vision and can have a positive impact in people's lives. I love working with a team that can communicate well and coordinate their work but I don't mind having my own workload that I can handle and manage depending on each task's priority. I am open to both in-office and remote positions, commuting isn't an issue. I have an interest in esports, sports, games and artificial intelligence and would love to get the chance to work in any of those industries. 
If you have an opportunity that you think I might be a good fit for, send me an email at nicola.zara@outlook.it
